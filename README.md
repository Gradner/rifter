Simple Three.js combat flight simulator engine (this is the version designed to deploy to heroku, so node modules are not included, run "npm install" from your node shell on the root directory of the game to install dependencies)

Once installed, run "node app" to play!

Controls:

Directions - rotation
Shift - Turbo
Pgup - Zoomed view
Pgdwn - Rearview (looks super baller when running turbo)
